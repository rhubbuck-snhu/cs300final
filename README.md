# cs300final
The problem that needed solving in this project was the sorting and processing of course information for a university. Courses would be read in from an external file. Some courses would have prerquisites, and the program needed to be able to filter out courses with prerequisites that did not exist, and then sort the courses by alphneumeric order. Additionally, the program needed to be able to search for a specific course and print information to the user.
It was important to consider the data structure involved due to time and space complexity. I chose to utilize a vector because all data was going to be recieved at once, and a vector was the quickest way to create course data structures and sort accordingly. 
During development the main roadblocks were 1) creating my own file parsing function and 2) properly accounting for the variable number of prerequisites. The main resource I used was stackoverflow, and it was truly a trial and error process of slowly building the parsing function one element at a time. 
My work on this project has expanded my knowledge base of objects and file manipulation as well. Both of these aspects will be useful in my future career and course work. I also gained a new level of respect for proper commenting through my time spent looking over the parsing functions provided by the course.
